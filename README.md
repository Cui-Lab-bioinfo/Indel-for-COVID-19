# Indel-for-COVID-19
This reposity include codes for our manuscript "Identification of recurrent indels associated with fitness of SARS-CoV-2".
In this study, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to systematically investigate indels occurring in over 9 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes 
and revealed 33,407,079 deletions and 2,046,903 insertions. We fork the repository from [BVAS]{https://github.com/broadinstitute/bvas} and make our modifications
to analyze Indels.
